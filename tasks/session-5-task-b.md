# Session 5b Assignment: sncast Deployment 

In this session, you will **extend a [Counter contract](../starknet_contracts/src/contracts/counter.cairo)** and practice using **sncast** to send transactions.  

---
Deploy or use the given Counter contract, then use sncast to:
- Call `get_count` to check the initial value.
- Invoke `increment` twice.
- Call `get_count` again to verify it increased.
- Invoke `decrement` once.
- Call `get_count` again to verify it decreased.
